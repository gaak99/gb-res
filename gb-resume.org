* Experience
** June 2013 - June 2015, Seagate/Evault, San Francisco, CA.
I started with Evault -- a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seagate -- and last half of my tenure there we were brought into Seagate.
*** Software engineer, cloud storage R&D group.
**** Major project
***** LTS2.evault.com -  cheaper/faster-retreival (than AWS Glacier) long-term object storage
The svc was based on Openstack Swift object storage code (Python).  Swift ran on a Ubuntu server cluster.
****** I "owned" Swift S3 emulation module aka fixed many bugs
****** Data center to data center object replication perf improvements
****** Basic web services  w/Python Flask - passwd reset, etc.
** Sep 2012 - Jan 2013, MeetMeTix.com, Atlanta, GA.
*** Contract programmer, Python/Django Web Apps.
**** Major Projects:
***** Integrated/tested/refined Django-Social-Auth app for Facebook
      Single-sign-on feature.
***** Developed (Python) from scratch a full Selenium automated test suite.
** Oct 2001 - Jun 2012, Sun Micro (later sold to Oracle, Inc), Menlo Park, CA.
*** Software engineer, Solaris OS/Net Security technologies.
**** Recent Projects:
***** Refined initial design of proposed Solaris Secure Boot feature
      with an emphasis on next generation SPARC systems.
***** Developed (C language) diagnosability improvements of Secure
      (GSS/Kerberos) NFS/SMB features for Solaris.
***** Led team and co-designed/developed (C language) RPC-based DB
      replication protocol/feature for the Kerberos KDC. This code was
      fed upstream and subsequently released by MIT Kerberos
      Open Source Project.
***** Re-wrote (C language) kernel RPC GSS server module to fix major
      performance issues found while dogfooding building NFS server.
** Oct 1996 - Oct 2001, Sun Micro.
*** Software engineer, Solaris Sustaining OS/Net Name Services.
**** Diagnosed/coded/tested fixes for (C language) escalated bugs.
